# TonUINO "nuclear football"
TonUINO Clone based on ESP32 and VS1053

Based on the ideas of the TonUINO community http://discourse.voss.earth/

May this be of some inspiraton to do your own project and light some kids' eyes,

Note: I changed the JC button library to work in pull-up and pull-down modes. You will not be able to compile this as-is as a whole.
